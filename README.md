# The Todo List application is a lightweight web-based tool designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. Built using Node.js and Express, it allows users to add, update, and delete tasks. Users can easily add new tasks through a simple form, mark tasks as completed with checkboxes, and edit existing tasks directly inline. The application uses basic middleware for logging and error handling. Itâ€™s designed to be simple and minimalistic, focusing on core functionality. This project serves as a practical demonstration of building a RESTful API with Express and implementing updates using client-side JavaScript.
